## Project Title
NewsAlpha : Get Daily Dose of News

This app gives us daily news. You can also fetch news category wise such as General, Health, Sports, Technology, Science, Business and Entertaintment.
I have chosen country "India" for my news feed to get news from all over the India.

You may also see any lint errors in the console.
